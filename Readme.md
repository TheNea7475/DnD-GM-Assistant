A small script to help D&D GMs keep track of party and entities.

Planned features:
Add an UI since its only on console | Add loot table that generate random loot when an hostile entity dies

Update:
I'm rewriting everything in Python since its easier and this was a C developing exercise for me, but I don't need to exercise anymore
